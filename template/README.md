## Features

- Open-source web desktop environment built with Nuxt.js
- Fully extendable through themes, apps, and modules
- Bundled with popular Vue.js libraries like Pinia and VueUse
- Designed to make the most of the Nuxt.js ecosystem
- Styled with PrimeVue and Tailwind for a consistent UI
- Fully localizable with nuxt-i18n support

## Getting started

Bootstrap a new project by running:

```bash
npm create owd
```

Once the process is done, you can start to develop:

```bash
cd owd-client

# Run the dev server with hot-reload
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run generate
```

## Extend your desktop

Thanks to Tailwind and PrimeVue, you can create custom themes from scratch and ensure a consistent look across all apps. Each theme defines its own style, making your desktop both cohesive and uniquely yours.
